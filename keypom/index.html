<ol>
<li>People want a <em>cheap, customizable, and unique</em> onboarding experience for users.</li>
<li>Companies don’t want to expose <strong>full access keys</strong> in their backend servers.</li>
<li>dApps want a <em>smooth UX</em> for interactions that require deposits.</li>
</ol>
<p>To solve this, Keypom allows for the creation of highly customizable access keys. Each access key
has a different functionality depending on which type of <em>drop</em> they derive from. A drop can be thought
of as a bucket that access keys can be part of. An owner will create drops of a certain type
with a set of features that all the keys within it will derive from. A drop can be one of four
different types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simple drops</li>
<li>Non Fungible Token drops</li>
<li>Fungible Token drops</li>
<li>Function Call drops.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a drop has been created, all keys added will share the same behaviour as outlined by the type of drop
and the configurations present. These keys can be used to either claim with:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>existing</strong> NEAR account through the <code>claim</code> function.</li>
<li>A new account that doesn’t exist yet is created through the <code>create_account_and_claim</code> function.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shared-drop-customization"><a href="#shared-drop-customization">Shared Drop Customization</a></h2>
<p>While each <em>type</em> of drop has its own set of customizable features, there are some that are shared by <strong>all drops</strong>
These are outlined below.</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="doccomment">/// Each time a key is used, how much $NEAR should be sent to the claiming account (can be 0).</span>

<h2 id="simple-drops"><a href="#simple-drops">Simple Drops</a></h2>
<p>The most basic type of drop is the simple kind. Any keys that are part of a simple drop can
only be used for 1 thing: <strong>transferring $NEAR</strong>. Once the key is claimed, the claiming account
will receive the $NEAR specified in the <code>deposit_per_use</code>. Simple drops are a great way to send $NEAR to claiming accounts while not storing a lot
of information on the contract. Below are a couple use cases.</p>
<h5 id="backend-servers"><a href="#backend-servers">Backend Servers</a></h5>
<p>Let’s say you have a backend server that should send 10 $NEAR to the first 3
people that redeem an NFT. Rather than exposing your full access key in the backend server,
you could create a simple drop that either has 3 keys or 1 key that is claimable 3 times.
In the drop, you’d specify that each time the key is claimed, the specified account would
receive 10 $NEAR.</p>
<h5 id="recurring-payments"><a href="#recurring-payments">Recurring Payments</a></h5>
<p>Recurring payments are quite a common situation. If you need to send someone 10 $NEAR once a
month for 6 months, you could create a simple drop that has a <code>throttle_timestamp</code> of 1 month
in between uses and everytime it’s used, 10 $NEAR is sent to the account. In addition, you
could specify a <code>start_timestamp</code> to determine the date at which the key can first be used.</p>
<h5 id="quick-onboarding"><a href="#quick-onboarding">Quick Onboarding</a></h5>
<p>If you need to quickly onboard users onto NEAR, you could create a simple drop with a
small amount of $NEAR (enough to create a wallet) and set the claim permission to be
<code>CreateAccountAndClaim</code>. This means that the key can only be used to create accounts.
You can then add keys as you wish to the drop and give them out to users so they can create
accounts and be onboarded onto NEAR.</p>
<h2 id="non-fungible-token-drops"><a href="#non-fungible-token-drops">Non-Fungible Token Drops</a></h2>
<p>Non-Fungible Token drops are a special type that allows users to “preload” the drop with NFTs.
These tokens will then be <em>automatically</em> sent to the <strong>claiming user</strong>. The claiming flow
is fairly similar to simple drops in that users can either create an account or claim to an
existing one.</p>
<p>NFT drops are essentially a wrapper around simple drops. All the functionalities that simple
drops have are carried over but now, users can receive an NFT as well as $NEAR. This brings
introduces some customization and uniqueness to the use-cases.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work"><a href="#how-does-it-work">How does it work?</a></h3>
<p>Every drop has a field known as <code>registered_uses</code>. This tells the contract how many uses the
drop has across all its keys. For simple drops, this field doesn’t matter since all the uses
are paid for up-front when the drop is created or when keys are added. With NFT drops, however,
there is a 2 step process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the drop is created and all the $NEAR required is pre-paid for. This is the same as
simple drops, however, the <code>registered_uses</code> are set to 0.</li>
<li>Once the drop is created, the owner must send the contract the NFTs in order for keys to be
usable. This process is done through the <code>nft_transfer_call</code> workflow baked into the NFT standards.
It’s up to the owner to facilitate this process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever the contract receives tokens, it will push the ID to a vector. These IDs are <strong>popped</strong> off
whenever a key is used. A user will receive the most recent token sent to the contract as the
vector is acting like a <em>stack</em>.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases"><a href="#use-cases">Use Cases</a></h3>
<p>NFT drops work really well for when you want to send a <em>pre-existing</em> NFT to a user along with
some $NEAR. Since NFT drops are a light wrapper around simple drops, most of the use-cases are
the same although people can now get NFTs as well. This means you can onboard a user with some
$NEAR <strong>and</strong> they <em>get an NFT</em> too.</p>
<h3 id="nft-config"><a href="#nft-config">NFT Config</a></h3>
<p>Along with the default global configurations for drops, if you’d like to create an NFT drop,
you must specify the following pieces of information when the drop is created.</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> <span class="ident">NFTDataConfig</span> {
    <span class="doccomment">/// Which account ID will be sending the NFTs to the contract</span>
    <span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="ident">sender_id</span>: <span class="ident">AccountId</span>,
    <span class="doccomment">/// Which contract will the NFTs live on</span>
    <span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="ident">contract_id</span>: <span class="ident">AccountId</span>,
}</code></pre></div>
<p>By specifying this information, the drop is locked into only accepting NFTs from the sender and contract.</p>
<h2 id="fungible-token-drops"><a href="#fungible-token-drops">Fungible Token Drops</a></h2>
<p>A Fungible Token drop is also a light wrapper around the simple drop. It works very similarly to how its NFT
counterpart does. First, you’ll need to create the drop and then you can fund it with assets and register
key uses. The only difference between NFT and FT drops is that for FTs, you can over-register assets.</p>
<p>You can preload a drop with as many FTs as you’d like even if you don’t have the keys yet. This will spike the
<code>registered_uses</code> and then you can create keys and slowly eat away from this “total supply” overtime. If the
drop runs out, you can send it more FTs to top up. All the keys in the FT drop will share from this supply
and everytime a key is used, the <code>registered_uses</code> will decrement and the “total supply” will get smaller.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work-1"><a href="#how-does-it-work-1">How does it work?</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned in the NFT section, every drop has a field known as <code>registered_uses</code>. This tells the contract
how many uses the drop has across all its keys. For simple drops, this field doesn’t matter since all the uses
are paid for up-front when the drop is created or when keys are added. With FT drops, however,
there is a 2 step process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the drop is created and all the $NEAR required is pre-paid for. This is the same as
simple drops, however, the <code>registered_uses</code> are set to 0.</li>
<li>Once the drop is created, the owner must send the contract the FTs in order for keys to be
usable. This process is done through the <code>ft_transfer_call</code> workflow baked into the FT standards.
It’s up to the owner to facilitate this process.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-cases-1"><a href="#use-cases-1">Use Cases</a></h3>
<p>FT drops work really due to the fact that they support all the functionalities of the Simple drops, just with
more use-cases and possibilities. Let’s look at some use cases to see how fungible token drops can be used.</p>
<h5 id="recurring-payments-1"><a href="#recurring-payments-1">Recurring Payments</a></h5>
<p>Recurring payments are quite a common situation. Let’s say you need to send someone $50 USDC every week. You
could create a key with 5 claims that has a throttle_timestamp` of 1 week. You would then pre-load maybe the
first week’s deposit of $50 USDC and register 1 use or you could send $500 USDC for the first 10 weeks. At that
point, you would simply hand over the key to the user and they can claim once a week.</p>
<h5 id="backend-servers-1"><a href="#backend-servers-1">Backend Servers</a></h5>
<p>Taking the recurring payments problem to another level, imagine that instead of leaving the claims up to the
person, you wanted to automatically pay them through a backend server. They would give you their NEAR account
and you would send them FTs. The problem is that you don’t want to expose your full access key in the server.
By creating a FT drop, you can store <strong>only the function call access key</strong> created by Keypom in the server.
Your backend would them use the key to call the <code>claim</code> function and pass in the user’s account ID to send
them the FTs.</p>
<h5 id="creating-a-wallet-with-fts"><a href="#creating-a-wallet-with-fts">Creating a Wallet with FTs</a></h5>
<p>Another awesome use-case is to allow users to be onboarded onto NEAR and <strong>also</strong> receive FTs. As an example,
You could do a promotion where you’re giving away $10 USDC to the first 100 users that sign up to your mailing
list. You can also give away QR codes at events that contain a new fungible token that you’re launching. You can
simply create a FT drop and pre-load it with the FT of your choice. In addition, you can give it 0.02 $NEAR for
new wallets that are created.</p>
<p>You can pair this with setting the <code>on_claim_refund_deposit</code> flag to true which would make it so that if anyone claims
the fungible tokens and they <em>already have a wallet</em>, it will automatically refund you the 0.02 $NEAR. That money should
only be used for the creation of new wallets. Since your focus is on the fungible tokens, you don’t want to <strong>force users</strong>
to create a new wallet if they have one already by specifying the claim permission to be <code>CreateAccountAndClaim</code> but instead,
you want to be refunded in case they do.</p>
<h3 id="ft-config"><a href="#ft-config">FT Config</a></h3>
<p>Along with the default global configurations for drops, if you’d like to create a FT drop,
you must specify the following pieces of information when the drop is created.</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> <span class="ident">FTDataConfig</span> {
    <span class="doccomment">/// The contract that the FTs live on.</span>
    <span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="ident">contract_id</span>: <span class="ident">AccountId</span>,
    <span class="doccomment">/// The account ID that will be sending the FTs to the contract.</span>
    <span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="ident">sender_id</span>: <span class="ident">AccountId</span>,
    <span class="doccomment">/// How many FTs should the contract send *each time* a key is used.</span>
    <span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="ident">balance_per_use</span>: <span class="ident">U128</span>,
}</code></pre></div>
<p>By specifying this information, the drop is locked into only accepting FTs coming from the sender and contract. While
you can send as many FTs as you’d like and can over-pay, you <em>must</em> send at <strong>least</strong> enough FTs in one call to cover
1 use. As an example, if a drop is created such that 10 FTs will be sent when a key is used, you must send <strong>at least 10</strong>
and cannot break it up into separate calls where you send 5 one time and 5 another.</p>
<h2 id="function-call-drops"><a href="#function-call-drops">Function Call Drops</a></h2>
<p>Function call drops are by far the most powerful feature that Keypom provides. FC drops allow <strong>any</strong> method on <strong>any</strong>
contract to be executed. In addition, there are a huge variety of customizations and features you can choose from when
defining the drop that come on top of the global options. The possibilities are almost endless. State of the art NFT ticketing,
lazy minting NFTs, auto registration into DAOs, recursive key creation, analytics for marketing at events and much more.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work-2"><a href="#how-does-it-work-2">How does it work?</a></h3>
<p>Unlike NFT and FT drops, the function calls must have everything paid for <strong>upfront</strong>. There is no two step process
so the creation is similar to Simple drops. Once the drop is created and keys are added, you can immediately start using it.</p>
<h5 id="function-call-config"><a href="#function-call-config">Function Call Config</a></h5>
<p>When creating the drop, you have quite a lot of customization available. At the top level, there is a FC drop global
config similar to how the <em>general</em> config works.</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> <span class="ident">FCConfig</span> {
    <span class="doccomment">/// How much GAS should be attached to the function call if it&#39;s a regular claim.</span>
    <span class="doccomment">/// If this is used, you *cannot* go through conventional linkdrop apps such as mynearwallet</span>
    <span class="doccomment">/// since those *always* attach 100 TGas no matter what. In addition, you will only be able to</span>
    <span class="doccomment">/// call `claim` if this is specified. You cannot have an `attached_gas` parameter and also</span>
    <span class="doccomment">/// call `create_account_and_claim.</span>
    <span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="ident">attached_gas</span>: <span class="prelude-ty">Option</span><span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="ident">Gas</span><span class="op">&gt;</span>,
}</code></pre></div>
<h5 id="method-data"><a href="#method-data">Method Data</a></h5>
<p>In addition to the global config, the user can specify a set of what’s known as <code>MethodData</code>. This represents the
information for the function being called. Within this data, there are also a few optional configurations you can use
to extend your use cases. You’ll see how powerful these can be in the use cases <a href="#use-cases">section</a>.</p>
<p>For <strong>every key use</strong>, you can specify a <em>vector</em> of <code>MethodData</code> which allows you to execute multiple function calls each
time a key is used. These calls are scheduled 1 by 1 using a simple for loop. This means that most of the time, the function
calls will be executed in the order specified in the vector but it is not <em>guaranteed</em>.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the Gas available is split evenly between <em>all</em> the function calls and if there are too many,
you might run into issues with not having enough Gas. You’re responsible for ensuring that this doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>The vector of <code>MethodData</code> is <em>optional</em> for each key use. If a key use has <code>null</code> rather than <code>Some(Vector&lt;MethodData&gt;)</code>,
it will decrement the uses and work as normal such that the <code>throttle_timestamp, </code>start_timestamp` etc. are enforced. The only
difference is that after the key uses are decremented and these checks are performed, the execution <strong>finishes early</strong>. The null
case does <strong>not</strong> create an account or send <em>any</em> funds. It doesn’t invoke any function calls and simply <em>returns once the
checks are done</em>. This makes the null case act as a “burner” where you disregard any logic. This has many uses which will
be explored in the use cases <a href="#use-cases">section</a>.</p>
<p>If a key has more than 1 use, you can specify a <em>different vector</em> of <code>MethodData</code> for <strong>each use</strong>. As an example, you could
specify that the first use will result in a null case and the second use will result in a lazy minting function being called.
If you have multiple uses but want them all to do the same thing, you don’t have to repeat the same data. Passing in only 1
vector of <code>MethodData</code> will result in  <strong>all the uses</strong> inheriting that data.</p>
<h5 id="injected-fields"><a href="#injected-fields">Injected Fields</a></h5>
<p>There is one other piece of information that is <strong>automatically</strong> attached to the arguments being sent to the function.
This is known as the <code>injected_fields</code>. It is a decimal representation of the optional fields specified in the method data.
You can think of each of the <code>account_id_field</code>, <code>drop_id_field</code>, and <code>key_id_field</code> as representing a bit. If the field
was specified, the bit is on. If it isn’t, the bit is off. The binary looks as follows.</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="ident">LSB</span>
<span class="number">2</span><span class="op">^</span><span class="number">0</span> -&gt; <span class="ident">account_id_field</span>
<span class="number">2</span><span class="op">^</span><span class="number">1</span> -&gt; <span class="ident">drop_id_field</span>
<span class="number">2</span><span class="op">^</span><span class="number">2</span> -&gt; <span class="ident">key_id_field</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As an example, say the user had <code>MethodData</code> with the <code>account_id_field</code> set to <code>receiver_id</code>. This would mean that the
binary representation of the fields would look as follows. <code>001</code> which has a decimal equivalent to 1. The contract would
then pass in an <code>injected_fields</code>  value of 1.</p>
<p>If the user had <code>MethodData</code> with the <code>key_id_field</code> set to <code>key</code> and the <code>drop_id_field</code> set to “drop”, the binary
representation would be <code>110</code> which has a decimal equivalent to 6. The contract would then pass in an <code>injected_fields</code>
value of 6.</p>
<h6 id="motivation"><a href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h6>
<p>Let’s say there was an exclusive NFT contract that allowed the Keypom contract to mint NFTs as part of an FC drop. Only Keypom
had access to mint and NFTs could only be minted the arguments coming into the function contained a field <code>series</code> with a valid
number. Let’s say the owner created an exclusive drop that happened to have a drop ID of 5. They could then go to the NFT contract
and restrict NFTs to only be minted if:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>series</code> had a value of 5.</li>
<li>The Keypom contract was the one calling the function.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for this to work, when creating the drop, the owner would need to specify that the<code>drop_id_field</code> was set to a value of <code>series</code>
such that the drop ID is correctly passed into the function.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that the receiving contract has no way of knowing which arguments were sent by the <strong>user</strong> upon drop creation
and which arguments are populated by the Keypom contract. There is nothing stopping a malicious user from creating a new drop that has an ID of 6 but
hardcoding in the actual arguments that <code>series</code> should have a value of 5. In this case, the malicious drop would have <em>no</em> <code>drop_id_field</code>
and the NFT contract would have no way of knowing that the <code>series</code> value is malicious.</p>
<p>This can be prevented if a new field is introduced representing what was automatically injected by the Keypom contract itself. At the
end of the day, Keypom will <strong>always</strong> send correct information to the receiving contracts. If those contracts have a way to know what has
been sent by Keypom and what has been manually set by users, the problem is solved. In the above scenario, the NFT contract would simply add
an assertion that the <code>injected_fields</code> is 3 (binary 011) meaning that the drop ID and account ID fields have been sent by the Keypom contract.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases-2"><a href="#use-cases-2">Use Cases</a></h3>
<p>Function call drops are the bread and butter of the Keypom contract. They are the most powerful and complex drops that can currently be created.
With this complexity, there are an almost infinite number of use-cases that arise.</p>
<h5 id="proof-of-attendance-protocols"><a href="#proof-of-attendance-protocols">Proof of Attendance Protocols</a></h5>
<p>A very common use case in the space is what’s known as Proof of Attendance. Often times when people go to events, they want a way to prove
that they were there. Some traditional approaches would be to submit your wallet address and you would be sent an NFT or some other form of
proof at a later date. The problem with this is that it has a very high barrier to entry. Not everyone has a wallet.</p>
<p>With Keypom, you can create a function call drop that allows people to onboard onto NEAR if they don’t have a wallet or if they do, they can
simply use that. As part of the onboarding / claiming process, they would receive some sort of proof of attendance such as an NFT. This can
be lazy minted on-demand such that storage isn’t paid up-front for all the tokens.</p>
<p>At this point, the event organizers or the funder can distribute links to people that attend the event in-person. These links would then be
claimed by users and they would receive the proof of attendance.</p>
<h5 id="auto-registration-into-daos"><a href="#auto-registration-into-daos">Auto Registration into DAOs</a></h5>
<p>DAOs are a raging topic in crypto. The problem with DAOs, however, is there is a barrier to entry for users that aren’t familiar with the
specific chain they’re built on top of. Users might not have wallets or understand how to interact with contracts. On the contrary, they
might be very well versed or immersed in the DAO’s topics. They shouldn’t be required to create a wallet and learn the onboarding process.</p>
<p>With Keypom, you can create a function call drop with the main purpose of registering users into a DAO. For people that have a wallet,
this will act as an easy way of registering them with the click of a link. For users that don’t have a wallet and are unfamiliar with
NEAR, they can be onboarded and registered into the DAO with the same click of a link.</p>
<h5 id="multisig-contracts"><a href="#multisig-contracts">Multisig Contracts</a></h5>
<p>Another amazing use-case for Keypom is allowing multisig contracts to have ZERO barrier to entry. Often times when using a multisig contract,
you will entrust a key to a trusted party. This party might have no idea what NEAR is or how to interact with your contract. With Keypom,
you can create a drop that will allow them to sign their transaction with a click of a link. No NEAR wallet is needed and no knowledge of the
chain is required.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, from the users perspective, they are given a link and when they click it, their portion of the multisig transaction is
signed. The action is only performed on the multisig contract once all links have been clicked. This is an extremely powerful way of doing
accomplishing multisig transactions with zero barrier to entry.</p>
<p>The users don’t even need to create a new account. They can simply call <code>claim</code> when the link is clicked which will fire the cross-contract call
to the multisig contract and pass in the injected fields that will be cross-checked by that contract.</p>
<h5 id="nft-ticketing"><a href="#nft-ticketing">NFT Ticketing</a></h5>
<p>The problem with current NFT ticketing systems is that they require users to have a wallet. This is a huge barrier to entry for people that
are attending events but don’t have wallets. In addition, there is often no proof of attendance for the event as the NFT is burned in order
to get into the event which requires an internet connection.</p>
<p>Keypom aims to solve these problems by having a ticketing system that has the following features.</p>
<ul>
<li>No wallet is needed to enter the event or receive a POAP.</li>
<li>No wifi is needed at the door.</li>
<li>An NFT is minted on-demand for each user that attends the event.</li>
<li>Users can optionally onboard onto NEAR if they don’t have a wallet.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, some way to provide analytics to event organizers that contains information such as links that were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given out but not clicked at all.</li>
<li>Clicked but not attended.</li>
<li>Partially claimed indicating the number of people that attended but did not onboard or receive a POAP.</li>
<li>Fully claimed indicating the number of people that attended and received a POAP.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to accomplish this, you can create a drop that has 3 uses per key. These uses would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Array(<code>null</code>)</li>
<li>Array(<code>null</code>)</li>
<li>Array(function call to POAP contract to lazy mint an NFT)</li>
</ol>
<p>The event organizer would create the links and distribute them to people however they see fit. When a user receives the link, the first
claim is automatically fired. This is a <code>null</code> case so nothing happens except for the fact that the key uses are decremented. At this point,
the organizer knows that the user has clicked the link since the uses have been decremented.</p>
<p>The next claim happens <strong>only</strong> when the user is at the door. Keypom would expose a QR code that can only be scanned by the bouncer’s phone.
This QR code would appear once the first link is clicked and contains the private key for the link. At the event, they wouldn’t need any wifi
to get in as they only need to show the bouncer the QR code. Once the bouncer scans it, the site would ensure that they have exactly 2 out of
the 3 uses left. If they don’t, they’re not let in. At that point, a use is decremented from the key and the next time they visit the
ticket page (when they have internet), they would be able to claim the final use and be onboarded / receive a POAP.</p>
